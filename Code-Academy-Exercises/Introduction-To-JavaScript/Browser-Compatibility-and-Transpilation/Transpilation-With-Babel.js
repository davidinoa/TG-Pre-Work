var pasta = 'Spaghetti'; // ES5 syntax

const meat = 'Pancetta'; // ES6 syntax

let sauce = 'Eggs and cheese'; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
const carbonara = `You can make carbonara with ${pasta}, ${meat}, and a sauce made with ${sauce}.`;

// Because ES6 is predictably backwards compatible, a collection of JavaScript programmers developed a JavaScript library called Babel that transpiles ES6 JavaScript to ES5.
