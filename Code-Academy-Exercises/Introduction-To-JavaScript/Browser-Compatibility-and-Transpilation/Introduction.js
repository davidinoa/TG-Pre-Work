var pasta = 'Spaghetti'; // ES5 syntax

const meat = 'Pancetta'; // ES6 syntax

let sauce = 'Eggs and cheese'; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
const carbonara = `You can make carbonara with ${pasta}, ${meat}, and a sauce made with ${sauce}.`;

// Upon release, web developers quickly adopted the new ES6 syntax, as it improved readability and efficiency. However, ES6 was not supported by most web browsers, so developers ran into browser compatibility issues.
